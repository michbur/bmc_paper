	abstract = {Microbead-based technologies represent elegant and versatile 
approaches for highly parallelized quantitative multiparameter assays. They also 
form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic 
acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, 
solid-phase {PCR}, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been 
improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and 
point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low 
costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of 
microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be 
found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of 
pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on 
microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid 
detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems 
using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of 
microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems 
(mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections 
on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), 
quantification of nucleic acids, {PCR} in solution and the detection of 
amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends 
such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous {DNA} 
hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital 
microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in 
terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and 
personalized medicine. Contains 211 references.},

	abstract = {The {chipPCR} package is a toolkit of functions to preprocess amplification curve data. Amplification data can be obtained from conventional {PCR} reactions or isothermal amplification reactions. The package contains functions to normalize and baseline amplification curves, a routine to detect the start of an amplification reaction, several smoothers for amplification data, a function to distinguish positive and negative amplification reactions and a function to determine the amplification efficiency. The smoothers are based on {LOWESS}, moving average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay and others. In addition the first approximate approximate derivative maximum ({FDM}) and second approximate derivative maximum ({SDM}) can be calculated by a 5-point-stencil as quantification points from real-time amplification curves. {chipPCR} contains data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems including the {VideoScan} {HCU} and a capillary convective {PCR} ({ccPCR}) system. The amplification data were generated by helicase dependent amplification ({HDA}) or polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) under various temperature conditions. As detection system intercalating dyes ({EvaGreen}, {SYBR} Green) and hydrolysis probes ({TaqMan}) were used. The latest source code is available via: https://github.com/michbur/{chipPCR}},

	abstract = {The analysis of different biomolecules is of prime importance for life science research and medical diagnostics. Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, {VideoScan}, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for {PCR} applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a {HEp}-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives {VideoScan} a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to

Reverse transcription ({RT)} in combination with quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} 
has 
become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such {RNA} molecules. 
In parallel with the democratization of {RT-qPCR} and its increasing use in 
biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number 
of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on 
the 
principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the 
cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, 
the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical 
algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the 
efficiency 
of the {PCR} reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined 
and 
applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the {PCR} 
efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to 
the 
development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published 
comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a 
restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed 
at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve 
analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods 
were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set 
(Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied 
their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve 
analysis 
methods' impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of 
expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification 
accuracy. 
The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished 
technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the 
algorithms' precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist 
between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most 
methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the 
analysis 
results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further

Calculating accurate {mRNA} levels requires important parameters such as 
reaction efficiency and the fractional cycle number at threshold ({CT)} to be 
used; however, many algorithms currently in use estimate these important 
parameters. Here we describe an objective method for quantifying {qRT-PCR} 
results using calculations based on the kinetics of individual {PCR} reactions 
without the need of the standard curve, independent of any assumptions or 
subjective judgments which allow direct calculation of efficiency and {CT.} We 
use a four-parameter logistic model to fit the raw fluorescence data as a 
function of {PCR} cycles to identify the exponential phase of the reaction. 
Next, we use a three-parameter simple exponent model to fit the exponential 
phase using an iterative nonlinear regression algorithm. Within the exponential 
portion of the curve, our technique automatically identifies candidate 
regression values using the P-value of regression and then uses a weighted 
average to compute a final efficiency for quantification. For {CT} 
determination, we chose the first positive second derivative maximum from the 
logistic model. This algorithm provides an objective and noise-resistant method 
for quantification of {qRT-PCR} results that is independent of the specific 
equipment used to perform {PCR} reactions.},

most sensitive and accurate methods for quantifying transcript levels 
especially 
for those expressed at low abundance. The selective amplification of target 
{DNA} over multiple cycles allows its initial concentration to be determined. 
The amplification rate is a complex interplay of the operating conditions, 
initial reactant concentrations, and reaction rate constants. Experimentally, 
the compounded effect of all factors is quantified in terms of an effective 
efficiency, which is estimated by curve fitting to the amplification data. We 
present a comprehensive model of {PCR} to study the effect of various reactant 
concentrations on the amplification efficiency. The model is used to calculate 
the kinetic progression of the target {DNA} concentration with cycle number 
under conditions when different species are stoichiometrically or kinetically 
limiting. The reaction efficiency remains constant for the initial cycles. As 
the primer concentration becomes limiting, the efficiency is marked by a 
gradual 
decrease. This is in contrast to a steep decline under nucleotide limiting 
conditions. Under some conditions, commonly used experimentally, increasing 
primer concentration has the adverse effect of reducing the final amplified 
template concentration. This phenomenon seen at times experimentally is 
explained by the simulation results under rate limiting enzyme concentrations. 
Primer dimer formation is shown to significantly affect the reaction rates, 
effective efficiency, and the estimated initial concentrations. This model, by 
describing the interplay of the many operating variables, will be a useful tool 
in designing {PCR} conditions and evaluating its results.},

{METHODS:} Light-up probe-based real-time {PCR} was used to quantify {IgLkappa} 
and {IgLlambda} {cDNA} from 32 clinical samples. The samples were also 
investigated by routine immunohistochemical analysis and flow cytometry.
{RESULTS:} Of 32 suspected non-Hodgkin lymphoma samples analyzed, 28 were 
correctly assigned from real-time {PCR} measurements assuming invariant {PCR} 
efficiencies in the biological samples. Four samples were false negatives. One 
was a T-cell lymphoma, one was a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and one was 
reanalyzed and found lymphoma-positive by in situ calibration, which takes into

{CONCLUSIONS:} This work is a first step toward analyzing clinical samples by

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6750-8-47},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Based upon defining a common reference point, 
current real-time quantitative {PCR} technologies compare relative differences 
in amplification profile position. As such, absolute quantification requires 
construction of target-specific standard curves that are highly resource 
intensive and prone to introducing quantitative errors. Sigmoidal modeling 
using 
nonlinear regression has previously demonstrated that absolute quantification 
can be accomplished without standard curves; however, quantitative errors 
caused 
by distortions within the plateau phase have impeded effective implementation 
of 
this alternative approach.
{RESULTS:} Recognition that amplification rate is linearly correlated to 
amplicon quantity led to the derivation of two sigmoid functions that allow 
target quantification via linear regression analysis. In addition to 
circumventing quantitative errors produced by plateau distortions, this 
approach 
allows the amplification efficiency within individual amplification reactions 
to 
be determined. Absolute quantification is accomplished by first converting 
individual fluorescence readings into target quantity expressed in fluorescence 
units, followed by conversion into the number of target molecules via optical 
calibration. Founded upon expressing reaction fluorescence in relation to 
amplicon {DNA} mass, a seminal element of this study was to implement optical 
calibration using lambda {gDNA} as a universal quantitative standard. Not only 
does this eliminate the need to prepare target-specific quantitative standards, 
it relegates establishment of quantitative scale to a single, highly defined 
entity. The quantitative competency of this approach was assessed by exploiting 
"limiting dilution assay" for absolute quantification, which provided an 
independent gold standard from which to verify quantitative accuracy. This 
yielded substantive corroborating evidence that absolute accuracies of +/- 25\% 
can be routinely achieved. Comparison with the {LinReg} and Miner automated 
{qPCR} data processing packages further demonstrated the superior performance 
of 
this kinetic-based methodology.
{CONCLUSION:} Called "linear regression of efficiency" or {LRE}, this novel 
kinetic approach confers the ability to conduct high-capacity absolute 
quantification with unprecedented quality control capabilities. The 
computational simplicity and recursive nature of {LRE} quantification also 
makes 
it amenable to software implementation, as demonstrated by a prototypic Java 
program that automates data analysis. This in turn introduces the prospect of 
conducting absolute quantification with little additional effort beyond that 
required for the preparation of the amplification reactions.},

Then, linear regression is applied to the natural logarithm of the transformed

the error in subtracting an unknown background, and thus it is more accurate

  Abstract 	 	   = {The PMML package exports a variety of predic- 
tive 
and descriptive models from R to the Predic- tive Model Markup Language (Data 
Mining Group, 2008). PMML is an XML-based language and has become the de-facto 
standard to represent not only predictive and descriptive models, but also data 
pre- and post-processing. In so doing, it allows for the interchange of models 
among different tools and en- vironments, mostly avoiding proprietary issues 
and 
incompatibilities.
The PMML package itself (Williams et al., 2009) was conceived at first as part 
of Togaware’s data min- ing toolkit Rattle, the R Analytical Tool To Learn Eas- 
ily (Williams, 2009). Although it can easily be ac- cessed through Rattle’s 
GUI, 
it has been separated from Rattle so that it can also be accessed directly in R.
In the next section, we describe PMML and its overall structure. This is 
followed by a description of the functionality supported by the PMML pack- age 
and how this can be used in R. We then discuss the importance of working with a 
valid PMML file and finish by highlighting some of the debate sur- rounding the 
adoption of PMML by the data mining community at large.

correction. A {PCR} efficiency value can be derived from the relative increase 
in fluorescence in the exponential phase of the amplification curve for all 
monitoring chemistries. In case of hydrolysis probes, {LUX} primers and hairpin 
primers, however, this should be performed after cycle 12, and for the {QZyme}

on-site 
rapid detection of {DNA} or {RNA} are increasingly being developed. Here, 
amplification of the target sequence is key to increasing sensitivity, enabling 
single-cell and few-copy nucleic acid detection. The several advantages to 
miniaturizing amplification reactions and coupling them with sample preparation 
and detection on the same chip are well known and include fewer manual steps, 
preventing contamination, and significantly reducing the volume of expensive 
reagents. To-date, the majority of miniaturized systems for nucleic acid 
analysis have used the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} for amplification and 
those systems are covered in previous reviews. This review provides a thorough 
overview of miniaturized analysis systems using alternatives to {PCR}, 
specifically isothermal amplification reactions. With no need for thermal 
cycling, isothermal microsystems can be designed to be simple and low-energy 
consuming and therefore may outperform {PCR} in portable, battery-operated 
detection systems in the future. The main isothermal methods as miniaturized 
systems reviewed here include nucleic acid sequence-based amplification 
({NASBA)}, loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP)}, helicase-dependent 
amplification ({HDA)}, rolling circle amplification ({RCA)}, and strand 
displacement amplification ({SDA).} Also, important design criteria for the 
miniaturized devices are discussed. Finally, the potential of miniaturization 
of 
some new isothermal methods such as the exponential amplification reaction 
({EXPAR)}, isothermal and chimeric primer-initiated amplification of nucleic

	abstract = {Real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} is one of the 
most sensitive and accurate methods for quantifying transcript levels 
especially 
for those expressed at low abundance. The selective amplification of target 
{DNA} over multiple cycles allows its initial concentration to be determined. 
The amplification rate is a complex interplay of the operating conditions, 
initial reactant concentrations, and reaction rate constants. Experimentally, 
the compounded effect of all factors is quantified in terms of an effective 
efficiency, which is estimated by curve fitting to the amplification data. We 
present a comprehensive model of {PCR} to study the effect of various reactant 
concentrations on the amplification efficiency. The model is used to calculate 
the kinetic progression of the target {DNA} concentration with cycle number 
under conditions when different species are stoichiometrically or kinetically 
limiting. The reaction efficiency remains constant for the initial cycles. As 
the primer concentration becomes limiting, the efficiency is marked by a 
gradual 
decrease. This is in contrast to a steep decline under nucleotide limiting 
conditions. Under some conditions, commonly used experimentally, increasing 
primer concentration has the adverse effect of reducing the final amplified 
template concentration. This phenomenon seen at times experimentally is 
explained by the simulation results under rate limiting enzyme concentrations. 
Primer dimer formation is shown to significantly affect the reaction rates, 
effective efficiency, and the estimated initial concentrations. This model, by 
describing the interplay of the many operating variables, will be a useful tool 
in designing {PCR} conditions and evaluating its results.},

cycle number, {maxRatio} generates several measurements of amplification 
including cycle numbers and relative measures of amplification efficiency and 
curve shape. By using these values, the {maxRatio} method can make highly 
reliable reactive/nonreactive determination along with quantitative evaluation. 
Application of the {maxRatio} method to the analysis of quantitative and 
qualitative real-time {PCR} assays is shown along with examples of method 
robustness to, and detection of, amplification response anomalies.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} is a well established method for the 
precise quantification of nucleic acids. However, there is an ongoing 
development of novel device concepts for {qPCRs}, hybridization and melting 
curve analysis. This includes lab-on-chip systems or the recently published 
microbead-based {VideoScan} platform [1]. Besides dedicated hardware an easy to 
use software for data analysis is also a requirement during developmental 
processes. Experimental instruments usually collect data of different formats 
and quality. Analysis software must therefore be able to preprocess data of 
different origins. Preprocessing includes data import, removal of missing 
values, selection of data ranges, outlier removal, detection of background 
signal, data transformation and smoothing /normalization of data. Subsequently, 
the software must be able to analyze and quantify both, the amplification and 
melting curve data. To automate this process we developed a set of plugins for 
the open source software {RKWard.} Novel technologies provide scientist with a 
high degree of freedom to adapt a system to specific requirements. {RKWard} 
provides all tools of R for an interactive data analysis and presentation, a 
dedicated output file and an output window for documenting results and figures. 
{RKWard} does not impose artificial limitations on how users can work with the 
application. For example, the user is not limited to using only one data.frame 
or one model at a time. The software aims to accelerate the development process 
and to enable easier collaboration between colleagues in the hardware and 
wetware disciplines. The plugins presented here are currently in beta stage and 
available upon request. In future the plugins will be provided for downloading 
as contributed “plugin Packs".},

	abstract = {The quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR)} is the central 
technology for the quantification of nucleic acids. The ability to perform 
multiplex quantitative real-time {PCRs} ({mqPCR)} in one vessel depends on 
parallel read-out and high sample multiplexing. Conventional {mqPCRs} are 
challenging due to the lack of multiple spectral non-overlapping reporter dyes 
and technical limitations of the detection systems. Recently we published a 
highly versatile microscopy platform, designated {VideoScan}, for the rapid and 
simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic 
detection. It uses standard commercial hardware components together with a 
modular in-house developed software package. Multiplex assays can be performed 
in solution or on solid-phases as microbead-based assays and cell assays using 
conventional consumables. The system has been proven to be applicable for 
multiplex {qPCRs}, nucleic acid hybridization assays and melting curve analysis 
[1]. As we proposed earlier [2] our microbead technology in combination with 
{qPCR} generates a powerful technology for multiplex quantitative {PCRs.} In the 
present work we demonstrate our {VideoScan} technology for microbead-based 
multiplex quantitative real-time {PCRs.} The assay employs the interaction 
between gene-specific capture probes bound to thermostable microbeads and mobile 
gene-specific degradable detection probes which report the amplification. Our 
system requires only two encoding dyes for encoding of multiple microbead 
populations and one reporter dye for microbead bound capture probes for the 
discrimination of at least twelve amplification reactions. We used the method 
for the quantitative detection of several human and bacterial genes. The assay 
is amplicon size independent, requires no alteration of the {PCR} product, 
employs a simple probe structure and has no background fluorescence. Early 
results indicate that the amplification efficiency is similar to reactions in 
solution.

We had observed that these models are not optimal in the fitting outcome due to the inherent constraint of symmetry around the point of inflection.

	volume = {7},
	issn = {1472-6750},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2213645/},
	doi = {10.1186/1472-6750-7-76},
	abstract = {Background
{EvaGreen} ({EG}) is a newly developed {DNA}-binding dye that has recently been used in quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}), post-{PCR} {DNA} melt curve analysis and several other applications. However, very little is known about the physicochemical properties of the dye and their relevance to the applications, particularly to {qPCR} and post {PCR} {DNA} melt curve analysis. In this paper, we characterized {EG} along with a widely used {qPCR} dye, {SYBR} Green I ({SG}), for their {DNA}-binding properties and stability, and compared their performance in {qPCR} under a variety of conditions.

Results
This study systematically compared the {DNA} binding profiles of the two dyes under different conditions and had these findings: a) {EG} had a lower binding affinity for both double-stranded {DNA} ({dsDNA}) and single-stranded {DNA} ({ssDNA}) than {SG}; b) {EG} showed no apparent preference for either {GC}- or {AT}-rich sequence while {SG} had a slight preference for {AT}-rich sequence; c) both dyes showed substantially lower affinity toward {ssDNA} than toward {dsDNA} and even lower affinity toward shorter {ssDNA} fragments except that this trend was more pronounced for {EG}. Our results also demonstrated that {EG} was stable both under {PCR} condition and during routine storage and handling. In the comparative {qPCR} study, both {EG} and {SG} exhibited {PCR} interference when used at high dye concentration, as evident from delayed Ct and/or nonspecific product formation. The problem worsened when the chain extension time was shortened or when the amplicon size was relatively long ({\textgreater}500 bp). However, {qPCR} using {EG} tolerated a significantly higher dye concentration, thus permitting a more robust {PCR} signal as well as a sharper and stronger {DNA} melt peak. These differences in {qPCR} performance between the two dyes are believed to be attributable to their differences in {DNA} binding profiles.

Conclusion
These findings suggest that an ideal {qPCR} dye should possess several {DNA}-binding characteristics, including a "just right" affinity for {dsDNA} and low or no affinity for {ssDNA} and short {DNA} fragments. The favorable {DNA}-binding profile of {EG}, coupled with its good stability and instrument-compatibility, should make {EG} a promising dye for {qPCR} and related applications.},

	abstract = {Herein we describe a simple platform for rapid {DNA} amplification using convection. Capillary convective {PCR} ({CCPCR}) heats the bottom of a capillary tube using a dry bath maintained at a fixed temperature of 95°C. The tube is then cooled by the surrounding air, creating a temperature gradient in which a sample can undergo {PCR} amplification by natural convection through reagent circulation. We demonstrate that altering the melting temperature of the primers relative to the lowest temperature in the tube affects amplification efficiency; adjusting the denaturation temperature of the amplicon relative to the highest temperature in the tube affects maximum amplicon size, with amplicon lengths of ≤500 bp possible. Based on these criteria, we successfully amplified {DNA} sequences from three different viral genomes in 30 min using {CCPCR}, with a sensitivity of {\textasciitilde}30 copies per reaction.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.
{CONTENT}: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} Experiments ({MIQE}) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. {MIQE} is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating {qPCR} experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.
{SUMMARY}: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},
