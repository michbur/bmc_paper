\section{Motivation:}
The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative 
isothermal amplification (qIA) are standard methods for the quantification of 
nucleic acids. Numerous real-time read-out technologies with different technical 
foundations have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification 
based techniques, there are only few tools for amplification data 
pre-processing. Especially, during development of new instruments a transparent 
tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable.

\section{Results:}
$\emph{chipPCR}$ is an \textbf{R} package for pre-processing and quality 
analysis of amplification curve data. The package takes advantage of 
\textbf{R}'s \emph{S4} object model and offers an extensible environment. 
$\emph{chipPCR}$ contains tools for the raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, 
imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for the amplification curve smoother and a function to detect the start 
and end of an amplification curve. Capabilities of the software are enhanced by 
implementation of algorithms yet not present in \textbf{R}, as a 5-point stencil
for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle 
calculation, and 22 data sets from various qPCR and qIA experiments are also part of 
the package. The core functionalities of $\emph{chipPCR}$ are integrated in
GUIs (web-based and standalone \emph{shiny} applications) streamlining analysis and report generation.

\section{Introduction}

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative isothermal 
amplification (qIA) are standard methods to amplify nucleic acids. These methods 
are used in real-time monitoring technologies, such as our previously reported 
VideoScan technology, microfluidic systems, point-of-care devices, and qPCR 
cyclers. Real-time technologies enable the quantification of nucleic acids by 
calculation of specific curve parameters like the quantification point (Cq) and 
the amplification efficiency (AE) 
\citep{roediger_highly_2013,rodiger_nucleic_2014,pabinger_2014}. Fundamental 
steps of amplification curve analysis are: (1) raw data read-in, (2) 
pre-processing (e.g., noise reduction), (3) amplification curve processing 
(e.g., Cq calculation), (4) post-processing, (5) data 
export/report generation. \textbf{R} belongs to the most used bioinformatic	
tools and is a rapid adopter for various technologies like digital PCR, 
NanoString nCounter Platform, and qPCR \citep{waggott_2012,pabinger_2014}. Most 
qPCR \textbf{R} packages focus on the read-in and (post)-processing of data from 
commercial qPCR systems. \textbf{R} packages for the steps 1. and 3.--5. above are 
available \citep{pabinger_2014,perkins_2012,mccall_2014,gehlenborg_2013}.
However, there is no \textbf{R} package for pre-processing and quality analysis 
of amplification curve data. Pre-processing is in most commercial cyclers a 
``black box'', which sets severe limits to reproducible research 
\citep{Leeper_2014}. Developmental qPCR and qIA technologies depend on tools to 
pre-process the raw data. Pre-processing algorithms remove stochastic errors and 
artefacts (Suppl. Sect.~2). Pre-processing addresses raw data % (Fig.~\ref{figure:problems})
inspection, raw data transformation in a format for successive analysis steps 
(e.g., smoothing, imputation), data reduction (e.g., removal of invalid sets) 
and data quality management. Misinterpretations are more likely if ``arbitrary'' 
corrections are performed. A manual alteration is in contradiction to 
reproducible research.

The $\emph{chipPCR}$ package (``Lab-on-a-\textbf{Chip}'' 
\& \textbf{PCR}) was developed to fill this gap by automatize 
pre-processing, data analysis/visualization and to offer a quality control for 
the statistical data analysis of qPCR and qIA experiments. \textbf{R} offers 
sophisticated statistical tools and allows reproducing analysis on different 
platforms as well as adopting to changing experimental setups. Moreover, it is 
desirable to set up workflows in an open environment, which offers GUIs, downstream 
analyses facilities, powerful tools for data visualizations and automatic 
report generation. The target audience encompasses developers and users who 
process raw data of commercial systems.

\section{Implementation}
\begin{methods}

We implemented the $\emph{chipPCR}$ package in the \textbf{R} software environment 
as described elsewhere \citep{RCT_2013,rodiger_rkward_2012}. $\emph{chipPCR}$ is 
a relative of the \emph{MBmca} \citep{roediger_RJ_2013}, the $\emph{RDML}$  
\citep{blagodatskikh_2014}, and the \emph{dpcR} \citep{pabinger_2014} packages 
but focusses on pre-processing of amplification curves. The package contains 
pre-processor functions (smoothing, imputation, background correction, 
normalization), a function for single-blinded randomized rating, quality 
analysis summary functions, a function to calculate the amplification 
efficiency, functions for amplification curve simulation and report 
generation (Suppl. Sect.~3). The supplemental material % Suppl. Sect.~\ref{sec:functions}
(package \textit{vignette}) uses Donald Knuth's literate programming 
principle~\citep{Knuth1984} to present the source code conveniently. 
$\emph{chipPCR}$'s naming convention is \textit{period.separated} 
\citep{Baaaath_2012}. We use \textbf{R}'s object model \emph{S4} class system 
(see \emph{methods} package) to separate between interface and implementation. 
It requires a higher effort than \emph{S3} classes, but assures better control 
on the object structure and the method dispatch. As a perquisite for 
high-throughput technologies, we avoided loops in the core structures and left 
options for partially parallel computing usage (e.g., \textsl{smoother} function) to 
keep the code fast. $\emph{chipPCR}$ includes a set of classes for plotting. The 
output of our custom made plots is minimalistic, but many parameters can be 
adjusted directly or by the ellipse parameter.

Our goal is to make our software available also for researchers not fluent in 
\textbf{R}. Therefore, we implemented core functionality of our package in 
selected GUI technologies available in \textbf{R} \citep{rodiger_rkward_2012} as 
desktop application or web-based service. $\emph{chipPCR}$ offers means to run 
the GUI applications as service on a server without installing \textbf{R} (e.g., 
http://michbur.shinyapps.io/MFIaggr\_gui/), on the local 
desktop (e.g., Fig.~S2, S6), or as deployed from an external % Fig.~\ref{figure:browser}
source for a local \textbf{R} installation. The functions \textsl{AmpSim}, 
\textsl{th.cyc}, \textsl{bg.max} and \textsl{amptester} are part of online GUIs. 
We aimed to build monolithic systems to parse, pre-process and analyze 
amplification curve data in a combined work-flow. 

We avoided relying on specialized parsers but rather use native \textbf{R} 
workspaces, and dedicated \textbf{R} packages as default data format for import 
and export as described elsewhere \citep{perkins_2012, RCT_2013}. 
$\emph{chipPCR}$ presents \emph{S4} objects with tailored summary and plot 
methods. Data sets are an essential element of reproducible research 
\citep{Leeper_2014}. Our package contains 22 data sets from commercial and 
experimental cyclers along with the experimental settings (e.g., helicase 
dependent amplification (HDA)) (see Suppl.). % Suppl. Sect.~\ref{sec:XX}
\end{methods}

\section{Example: quality analysis}

\textsl{MFIaggr} is a versatile analytical and graphical tool for fast multiple 
comparison of the cycle dependent signal dispersion and distribution 
(Fig.~\ref{fig:01}). The continuous explanatory variable $x$ (cycle number) is 
used to describe its relationships to $n$ continuous predictor variables $y_i$ 
(fluorescence values), where $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$. Use cases include the 
comparison of independent reaction vessels or 
the analysis of replicate experiments (Suppl. Sect.~6). In % Suppl. Sect.~\ref{sec:MFIaggr}
particular, this function might be useful for quality management during the 
development of high-throughput technologies. An analysis via the \emph{shiny} 
\textsl{MFIaggr.gui} app is shown in Fig.~S6. % Fig.~\ref{figure:MFIaggr2}

\begin{figure}[!tpb]%figure1

\caption{Amplification curve analysis of 379 replicates. Cycles 1 to 14 were 
selected as region of interest (ROI) for \textsl{MFIaggr} to analyze the 
cycle-dependent variance (left panel) and gives a density plot (right upper 
panel) and quantile-quantile analysis (right lower panel), including a 
comprehensive statistical analysis as textual output (not shown). Plots 
indicate that the data of the background range are normal 
distributed.}\label{fig:01}

\section{Results and Conclusions}

There is an ongoing development for qPCR and qIA technologies. $\emph{chipPCR}$ 
is the first \textbf{R} package for the pre-processing and quality 
analysis of amplification curve raw data. $\emph{chipPCR}$ 
primarily targets pre-processing but standard methods to process 
amplification curves were also implemented. Functions of $\emph{chipPCR}$ are embeddable in 
customized routines with other packages (see Suppl.). For example, the packages 
\emph{RDML} and \emph{MBmca} depend on $\emph{chipPCR}$ technology. 
$\emph{chipPCR}$ is build from smaller blocks. We claim that the modular 
structure of $\emph{chipPCR}$ package allows users to perform flexible data 
analysis adjusted to their needs. Users can do estimations by hand. For example 
for quantification cycle (second derivative maximum, $SDM$) estimation, solely 
the $\emph{chipPCR}$ functions \textsl{inder} and \textsl{smoother} are needed. 
\textsl{smoother} will be a method of smoothing in \textsl{inder} and by putting 
data in the \textsl{bg} object with summary method \textsl{summary-der} the user 
obtains the $SDM$. Thanks to the GUI it should be easy even for an user without 
any \textbf{R} experience omitting the biggest limitation of all \textbf{R} 
packages related to qPCR and qIA.
